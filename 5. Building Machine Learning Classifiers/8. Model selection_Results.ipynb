Or, let's consider at text messages that have zero punctuation and see how our model does there. We'd slice it in a variety of different ways to really understand where the model's doing well, and maybe where it doesn't do well. That would also include looking at specific text messages that the model is getting wrong\n",

And, in this case, and this is very important, you make your decision based on the business problem or the business context. What that means is having a longer predict time going to create a huge bottleneck in your process. In some business context, having a model that takes over .2 seconds to predict might be a deal breaker so you might have no choice but to go with the GradientBoosting model."

    "Additionally, most problems either have a higher cost on false positives, which means you would prioritize precision, or false negatives, which means you'd prioritize recall. For instance, for a spam filter, you can probably deal with some spam in your inbox here and there, but you don't want your spam filter to capture real emails, so we'd prioritize here for precision. So when it says it's spam, it better be spam. In this case, false positives are very costly. \n",

    "The second case would be something like anti-virus software. False positives where they say that you have a virus but you really don't, that can be scary without a doubt, but if you're getting hacked and your software doesn't catch it, that's much, worse. In this case, we should optimize for recall so that if there's a breach, the model better be able to catch it. "

    "**Summary:** In this case, we should optimize for recall so that if there's a breach, the model better be able to catch it. With all that said, assuming that predict time is not a deal breaker for your business problem, and you don't necessarily have a super-clear answer of whether false positives or false negatives are more costly, the model that you'd probably select here is the RandomForest model. That's because the precision is so much better than the GradientBoosting model, and the recall is very close."
