# Chapter 5: Building Machine Learning Classifiers

This folder has exercise Jupyter Notebooks dealt and worked in this chapter.

### Dataset Details: 
The dataset used in this chapter is a semi-structured dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset is a collection of text messages, each with a label of 
either spam or ham. And the datafile is @[SMSSpamCollection.tsv](https://github.com/shreyagopal/NLP-with-Python-for-Machine-Learning-Essential-Training-Assignments/blob/master/5.%20Building%20Machine%20Learning%20Classifiers/SMSSpamCollection.tsv).

### Topics Covered:

* What is machine learning?
* Cross-validation and evaluation metrics
* Introducing random forest
* Building a random forest model
* Random forest with holdout test set
* Random forest model with grid search
* Evaluate random forest model performance
* Introducing gradient boosting
* Gradient-boosting grid search
* Evaluate gradient-boosting model performance
* Model selection: Data prep
