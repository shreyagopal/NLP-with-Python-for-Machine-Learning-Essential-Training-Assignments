    "**What is lemmatizing?** The formal definition is that it's the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed as a single term, identified by the word's lemma. The lemma is the canonical form of a set of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, type, typed, and typing would all be forms of the same lemma. More simply put, lemmatizing is using vocabulary analysis of words to remove inflectional endings and return to the dictionary form of a word. So again, type, typed, and typing would all be simplified down to type, because that's the root of the word. Each variation carries the same meaning just with slightly different tense."

    "The goal of both stemming and lemmatizing is to condense derived words down into their base form, to reduce the corpus of words that the model's exposed to, and to explicitly correlate words with similar meaning. \n",
    "\n",
    "The difference is that stemming takes a more crude approach by just chopping off the ending of a word using heuristics, without any understanding of the context in which a word is used. Because of that, stemming may or may not return an actual word in the dictionary. And it's usually less accurate, but the benefit is that it's faster because the rules are quite simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where as lemmatizing leverages more informed analysis to create groups of words with similar meaning based on the context around the word, part of speech, and other factors. Lemmatizers will always return a dictionary word. And because of the additional context it's considered, this is typically more accurate. But the downside is that it may be more computationally expensive."
